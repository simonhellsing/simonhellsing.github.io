			<h4>The challenge</h4>
			<p>With the threat of big-tech players like Google moving in to the mortgage space, Stater tasked Brilliant Basics with reimagining it’s digital offerings for mortgage advisors and moneylenders. The key goal was to improve ease of use and to solidify the Stater brand in the market.</p>

			<h4>The challenge</h4>
			<p>As the Design Lead of the project one of my main responsibilities was to ensure that the new visual direction and the UI that we developed would serve the needs of both the main user groups, Mortgage Advisors and Mortgage Consumers.  In order to do this, we started out with conducting interviews and workshops with Stater and representatives of their clients to get to the bottom of how they use the services today, and how they envision them working in the future.</p>

			<h4>The challenge</h4>
			<p>After having established a better understanding for what we were building, we set our sights on developing the visual language of the Stater brand and UI.  We kicked this off with a series of workshops where we defined the Design Principles of the Stater organization. This then led us into beginning our work on the Stater UI guidelines that would ensure that anything we designed and built would give our users a consistent experience while using the Stater services.</p>
